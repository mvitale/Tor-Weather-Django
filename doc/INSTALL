1) In weather, make a directory named "log".

2) In weather/settings.py, change the EMAIL_* fields to reflect your SMTP 
configurations and the email address for sending the Tor Weather notifications. 

3) In weather.config.config.py, change the listener_port and updater_port 
fields to reflect valid control ports in your local torrc file. These should be 
unique. Change the base_url field to reflect the base URL for the Tor Weather 
application.

4) A copy of (or link to) the TorCtl package must be located within the weather 
directory. 

5) Create the database by running the following command from within the weather
directory:
/weather$ python manage.py syncdb
(You don't need to create a superuser).

6) Look here for documentation concerning how to deploy the Django web 
application:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/

7) Once the application is deployed, the listener application should be run from
inside the weather directory:
/weather$ python manage.py runlistener
The listener waits for consensus events from your local TorCtl process, then 
updates the database and sends notifications.
WARNING: There should only be one instance of this application running at any
    one time. The application does send a single email to new, stable relay
    operators regardless of whether they've subscribed to Tor Weather. We hope
    to strictly limit the number of emails that are sent, so please do not run 
    this application if it is already deployed somewhere.
