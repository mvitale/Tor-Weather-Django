1) In weather, make a directory named "log".

2) In weather/settings.py, change the EMAIL_* fields to reflect your SMTP 
configurations and the email address for sending the Tor Weather notifications. 

3) In weather.config.config.py, change the listener_port and updater_port 
fields to reflect valid control ports in your local torrc file. These should be 
unique. Change the base_url field to reflect the base URL for the Tor Weather 
application.

4) A copy of (or link to) the TorCtl package must be located within the weather 
directory. 

5) Look here for documentation concerning how to deploy the Django web 
application:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/

6) Once the application is deployed, the listener application should be run from
inside the weather directory:
/weather$ python manage.py runlistener
The listener waits for consensus events from your local TorCtl process, then 
updates the database and sends notifications.
WARNING: As soon as this is run, it will send welcome emails to all routers.
	     To disable this when testing deploying the application, comment out
		 lines 298-303 of weatherapp/updaters.py (starting with if
		 "router_data.welcomed == False and ctl_util.is_stable(finger):" and
		 ending with "router_data.welcomed = True").
